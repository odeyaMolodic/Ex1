# OOP Ex1

This project represents a several types of functions, 
enable the user to do an arithmetic oparations on them (add, subtract, multiply...)

* Simple Monom of shape a*X^b, where a is a real number and b is an integer (none negative).
* Polynom, a list of monoms f(x) = a_1X^b_1 + a_2*X^b_2 ... a_n*Xb_n
supports operations such as derivative, compute an area by Riman's integral, and approximated value (root) for this function.
* Complex function of type y=g(f1(x), f2(x)), where both f1, f2 are functions (or complex functions), 
y and x are real numbers and g is an operation: plus, mul, div, max, min, comp (f1(f2(x))).
* The class Functions_GUI write or read from a file, a collection of functions 
and draws all the functions in the collection in a GUI window.
